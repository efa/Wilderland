2.10b - 20231203
----------------
Changed
- put WLS files in 'wls' directory, create it if missing
- if not found locally, download 'The Hobbit' binary, using libcurl
- get download link from WLconfig.txt config file
- unzip downloaded file, using libzip
- make NODL=1 to avoid include and link download and unzip function
- support for Linux AppImage: save/unzip The Hobbit binary in writable dir
- when still missing 'The Hobbit' binary show download link and instructions
- instructions loaded from config file WLCONFIG (file shown in the error)
- when WL won't start for non SDL reason (eg. miss The Hobbit binary),
  show a dialog box with error, as console errors cannot be seen
- map resolution 1280x496 increased to 1870x725
- option -MAP to undock map in a separate window
  connect window X to close also with undocked map
- switch to C99 fixed size types: uint32_t, uint16_t, uint8_t, int32_t 
  Spectrum.h: Uint32 Uint16 Uint8
  WL.c: InitGraphicsSystem(Uint32 WinMode)
  WL.c: main() Sint32
- remove LockScreen(winPtr); UnLockScreen(winPtr); LockLevel;
- removed some commented unused blocks
- read and show SDL version at compile and link time
- added WL.odg with includes and windows size design
- renamed GLOBAL_VARS.h to GlobalVars.h and SPECTRUM.h to Spectrum.h
- use osxcross-dmg(ricorsive findobj) to collect dylib
- applied my coding style
- use WLYEAR for copyright
Bugfix:
- try increased delay to 20 ms between SDLtext to avoid flicker on macOS
- switched to software rendering as on macOS flicker with red background
Modification to 'z80emu':
- remember HALT state on different calls. Quit HALT by IRQ or NMI
  z80emu.c: use state->status = Z80_STATUS_FLAG_HALT;
- fix z80emu.h enum for Z80_STATE's status to support Z80_CATCH_*
- documented I/O with 16 bit port address for z80emu

Note: the package WL2.10b_Z80_WinMxe32.7z is generated linked with Z80 CPU emulator, this is for compatibility with old WL1.x snapshot files, but those snapshots won't work with 64 bit binaries, and are incompatible with current default binary and snapshots, generated with z80emu CPU emulator of all other packages

2.09 - 20220907
---------------
- show object/NPC property 4,5,6 variations in console to help hacking
- save/load file names now support '-' and '_' (US and IT layout)
- support for backspace also in editing Go to room number
- Shift+0 for clearing the whole input line passed to The Hobbit
- macOS version now should save the .wls files without changing attributes
- macOS version now should start from the DockBar too
- added the compass rose on game map
- " and @ now are readed insensitive to NumLock state
- added sources to macOS package
- documented option -FIT to scale window to desktop resolution
- tested -FIT with anti-aliasing: same not good interpolation results
  SDL_SetHint(SDL_HINT_RENDER_SCALE_QUALITY, "best");
- reduced most flash / disappear gray border & cyan background
      SDLTWE_DrawTextWindowFrame(&***Win , 4, BORDERGRAY);
      SDL_RenderPresent(renPtr);
- README.txt/md without unwanted tag, now use wiki/html tag:
  # Titles     titles with bold and underline
  ========     titles with bold and underline
  * point 1    dot list
  ```code```   programming code
  <img src="doc/WL.png" width="500">   embed image
- 1 pixel imperfection in rectangles visible on snapshot
  ==> bug of 'SDL_RenderDrawRect(renPtr, &rect);'

2.08 - 20220822
---------------
- Added 'z80emu' a new Z80 emulator from Lin Ke-Fong with a free license
  Selection of the emulator can be made at compile time, see Makefiles
- New snapshot file format v2 to manage the Z80 emulator type
  Note: savefiles from different Z80 emulators are incompatible
- Added backspace management to name input in Load/Save snapshot game
- Save/Load file now automatically add .wls WilderLandSnapshot to the name
- Better keyboard input: " and @ are correctly read in US and IT locale
      ALT|SHIFT+P    ==> "   is used for to talk to NPC in direct speech
  US: SHIFT+'(")     ==> "
  IT: SHIFT+à(°)     ==> "
      ALT|SHIFT+2    ==> @   redo the last command
  US: SHIFT|ALT+;(:) ==> @
  IT: SHIFT|ALT+ò(ç) ==> @

  Added Z80ResetTable() to regenerate register pointers on snapshot load
  Added printZ80struct() to show internal register values
